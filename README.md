# flying-prototype
A score attack shoot 'em up made in Unity. Actually it's more of a prototype to test some flying mechanics ideas. You can find a playable version of this game with this link: https://tudormacovei.itch.io/flying-prototype.

Legacy Image Effects and unityglitch (https://github.com/staffantan/unityglitch) used for additional camera effects.
