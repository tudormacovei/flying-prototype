# flying-prototype
A score attack shoot 'em up made in Unity. There are 4 stages with randomized spawn points to beat! This project was mainly a prototype to test the 2D control physics for the player object. A playable version of this game at this link: https://tudormacovei.itch.io/flying-prototype.

Legacy Image Effects and unityglitch (https://github.com/staffantan/unityglitch) used for additional camera effects.
